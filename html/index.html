          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>My name is Jaime, and coding is my passion. After completing my internship in a technology company back in Spain, where I discovered my love for coding, I decided to make a full change in my life. I parted from my family and friends and moved to a new country with a new language to pursue my dream of learning and growing as a web developer and as a web designer.</p>
          <p>Creativity and adaptation are two of my biggest strengths, but I am also dedicated, practical, persistent and I pay close attention to details.</p>
          <p>I am a fast learner who sees an opportunity to learn and acquire knowledge in every problem or conflict I encounter. </p>

          <h2>What do I like to do?</h2>
          <p>Programming aside, my two big passions are sports and music. I have been playing all kinds of sports since I was a little kid. If I had to choose two sports, they would be skateboarding and football.</p>
          <p>Regarding music, I love listening to it everywhere I go. From a big music festival with my friends to putting my headphones on when I’m coding; every moment is a perfect opportunity to listen to some music.</p>

          <h2>Where do I come from?</h2>
          <p>I was born in Mexico, but I have lived in Spain for the last 12 years. After studying for a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology back in Madrid, I decided to make a change in my life and move to Miami to begin a whole new adventure.</p>
          <p>When I think of my future, I see myself living in a place where I can keep growing as a developer, as a designer and as a person.</p>
